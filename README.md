# Web Accessibility Extension

## Description
A Google Chrome extension which provides an accessibility layer on top of web pages in two important ways
- Automatically generate and add alt tags to images without them
- Automatically make texts contrast with their backgrounds with a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1

## Example
#### Before
Before our extension is applied.
![test website with poor text contrast and images with no alt tags](/before.png)

#### After
After our extension is applied with images disabled to see the alt text. Note the improvement in text readability.
![test website with our extension enabled but images disabled so it's clear that alt tags are added](/after.png)
